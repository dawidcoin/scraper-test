### Scraper test

Simple project to test github actions.

#### Usage

After cloning repo run:

```
cd scraper_test
source source_me.sh
create_venv
```

This will create and activate virtual environment.

`source_me.sh` also provides commands to run pytest (`tests`) and activate the environment (`activate`).

In order to use scraper start `main.py`: `python3 main.py <country>`
